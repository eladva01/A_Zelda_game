# Top-Down Adventure Game – Python & Pygame

A 2D top-down adventure game built with **Python** and **Pygame**, featuring multiple maps, indoor/outdoor environments, enemies, health system, and collision-based interactions.  
This project focuses on object-oriented architecture, map transitioning, combat mechanics, and sprite-based animation.
